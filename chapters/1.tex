\chapter{What is English Rationality?}

\separator

English Rationality is the rationality embedded in the English language. it is the native rationality of English. it is begotten by English, and is of English in the sense that its colour, temperament, and mettle of the English language.

English Rationality, is first and foremost, a rationality. What is rationality? It is the quality or substance or state of being rational. If "being rational" is a thing, that thing is rationality. What is a "rationality"? Rationality, prefixed by with an indefinite article "a" implicitly posits that there are multiple and other rationalities, i.e. there are multiple ways of being rational. English Rationality is merely one form of rationality, and it is the English one.

English Rationalituy is a rationalituy, and what is a rationality? Rationality comes in many layyers and degrees of sophsitication. But from a bird's eye view, rationality, is the setate of being able to put forth propositions, intelligently argue for them, ask "what if", contemplate what could or would have been, imagine the otherwise, and to make definitive conclusions after such exercises.

English Rationality, is the ability to eneterain an idea without accepting it. it is the ability and the habit to consdier ideas and propositions like objects of interest in the head.

English Rationality is that which can tell us what is reasonable, and what is not.
What is reasonable, is not necessarily what is justified, legitimate, or sound. It is something slightly weaker, thought simulatenously stronger and sounder than  nonsense or the absurd. The justified is what is already reasoned, therefore its reasonability is already established. The justified observes and recognizes events and facts, faithfully and accurately and describe them. 


What is "reasonable"  therefore only by defacturied convenience, just like how all women are girls. But the strict category what is reasonable, unless to the class of ideas and propsotions that to a person of sound mind i.e. endowed with the operationsal software of English Rationalitym would find to be jstufied, in a vague s and mecurial terms. He could see how the reasonable might be reasoned to establish itself, and therefore be reasoned when justified to do , even thought an actual application of the reasoning process might willingly yield a verdict in the negative. The reasoanble proposition is one that could be reasoned, and its status of freasoanble, is a state of onterm likelihood. 

Reasonability lends reasonability, reasonability is preserved between ideas that entail and ideas that are enetailed, just like truth is preserved in between statements. And to prove a statement, being proved. 


And so, in reasonability, one yield and inspiring interlocking web of reasonable ideas, each supporting others, such that one have fashioned a Grand Republic of reasonabilities. To carry this republic and to uphold, to operate it like a juror operates a jury, is to be in possession of English Rationality.

English Rationality, is therefore, very naturally, "Common Sense". 

"Reasonability" as the connector between propsoitions as aforementioned, is perhaps an inaccurate protrayl of this logical substance. That's to say, to characterize a proposition as reasonable, or to say "such and such is reasonable" if you accept so-and-so" means  there is a way to employ reason toand to explicate a line of reasoning from such-and-such so that so-and-so is demonstrated", is inaccurate. When one says "such-and-such is reasonable", what one is really saying that by the powers of common reason, and by adequate judgements, such-and-such is admissable as truth". In some cases, it might indeed turn out that there is an argument for such-and-such, but itw would be wrong to claim a statement is reasonably, if and only if, you can reason out the statement. When jduges and schoalrs and statements and phiklosophers claim pocilies and propositions to be reasonable, what they are reaally asserting, that they find the proposition in question to be admissiable, and it is admissiable because it was a reasonable person, a person of sound mind, a person of intellectual and adjudicational sincerity and integrity, that made this call - a call a judgement, an assessment - that is fundmanetllay, if one gets tot he bottom of it, ultimately arbitrary.

 English Rationality, is the language and mode of thinking of Hume, Locke, Mill, Benetham, Denning, Lord Wilson, Lord Patten, Churchill, Russell, Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins, Oscar Wilde, Christopher Hitchens, Derek Parfit, and Alex O Connell. It is language precisely used, to articulate ideas reasonably well formed.

What is English Rationality? It is something so embedded in English, and gives English such rational power, that oftentimes when one want to demand another to speak plainly so one may understand, one might simply make the demand "Speak English". "Speak English!" is a demand to speak reasonably, rationality, and understandably. "I can't understand this, please speak English" is a polite request to make complex ideas understandable. A chief executive running a financial empire, requesting his team to "Speak English", is to request for accommodation for lower intellectual bandwidth and horsepower. English Rationality, is that gem in the English language that enables this.

English Rationality has begotten Legalese. Legalese, is not English. "The contract is in Legalese, sir, let me put it in English for you." In that sense, Legalese is not English. But obviously, it the English language. It is the English language in a particular register, used in a particular profession. It is clearly borne of the English language, and is trained to be performant and capable in handling legal action and judisprudential questions. It is capable of doing so because it contains a particular mode of highly specified form of English Rationality.
